Thunder Tactics
===============

The old version of Thunder Tactics as it was last modified in June 2013. This
code was written together with [Tiberiu Pasat][1]. I published it here because
it was developed on the SVN of [FCS][2] which is private.

* Read the [Technical Report][3].
* View some demos: [first][4], [second][5].
* Read more [details][6] on Tiberiu Pasat's page.
